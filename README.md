# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on Codewars (www.codewars.com).

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

* **Track my progress:** By storing my solutions, I can easily review my past work and see how I've improved.
* **Share learning:** I hope that my solutions might be helpful to others who are learning and practicing coding.
* **Reflect and Refactor:** Occasionally I will revisit old katas to refactor my solutions to be more efficient, readable, or to explore alternative approaches.

## Organization

The repository is organized by:

* **Language:** Each language I use (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java) will have its own directory.
* **Kyu Level (Difficulty):** Within each language directory, solutions are further organized by kyu level (e.g., 8kyu, 7kyu, 6kyu).
* **Kata Name:** Each kata solution will be in its own file, named after the kata.


## Usage

Feel free to browse the solutions. If you find a solution helpful, great! However, please remember:

* **Don't just copy and paste:** The goal is to learn. Trying to understand the solutions and writing your own code is much more beneficial.
* **Codewars etiquette:** Please do not publicly share solutions in a way that violates Codewars' terms of service.
* **Solutions are not always optimal:** My solutions may not always be the most efficient or elegant. They reflect my understanding at the time I solved the kata.
